# Ecosystem-wide versioning policy: the version bumps automatically on
# every REAL build (every run of build.bat/build.sh - the only thing
# that counts as a "build" for a Rust binary; just running
# `cargo run` directly does NOT bump anything), using an odometer/
# mileage-counter rule in base 10: the last component (patch) goes up
# by 1; if it would roll past 9, it resets to 0 and carries 1 into the
# component to its left (minor), which repeats the same rule leftward
# (major has no component further left, so it just keeps counting past
# 9 with no reset - same as a real odometer's leftmost digit never
# wrapping back to 0 mid-drive).
# Example: 0.1.9 -> 0.2.0. Another: 0.9.9 -> 0.0.0.
#
# Called by build.bat/build.sh BEFORE `cargo build --release` runs, so
# every packaged binary carries a version strictly newer than the last
# one actually shipped (Cargo picks it up automatically via
# env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION") in src/main.rs). Standalone-runnable too
# (invoked twice in a row is how this script's own bump logic gets
# verified without needing a full cargo build each time).
